Hello, everyone! Nice to meet you again! Last time, we checked we can't be rich only with the salary. I think the reasonable two ways are making a side project and investment (like stocks). Let's talk about the investment.

Let's say we invest some of our precious money. Whenever we make a profit, we need to pay income tax. That sucks. But, what if you don't need to pay it? Awesome, right? Too good to be true? Thank God, Canadian government gave you a gift called TFSA.

TFSA stands for a Tax-free savings account. It is an account like your bank accounts. Put money, do whatever you want, except you don't pay any income tax when you make any profit with this account. Let's see an example. I put $1000 in the TFSA account. Everybody says the company called Banana will be the next Apple. So I bought 1000 shares of $1 stock. Next year, the stock becomes $100. Holy, I am rich now. $1000 becomes $100,000. Basically I made $99,000 profit. Normally I need to pay whatever income tax - if income tax is 10% (which is ridiculously small), it is $9,900. Do I need to pay about $10,000? Here is the beauty of the TFSA account. We don't need to pay any tax for the profit.

Then why the Canadian government provide this awesome gift? You will be shocked that many adults do not have a chance to save money. This TFSA is for encouraging savings. Personally, I think it is for encouraging people to invest in Canadian companies or similar. Anyway, I think you understood the purpose of the TFSA.

TFSA seems too good to be true. Is there any limit? Of course, there is. Canadian government sets the dollar limit you can put in the TFSA account. Again, let's see an example.

The year 2009, the limit was $5000. That means you can put $5000 in your TFSA account and the Canadian government won't care about whatever the profit you make with it. The year 2010, the limit was $5000 again. Again, that means you can put $5000 in your TFSA account and no one cares how much you make with it.

You must have this question. Oh, shoot. It is 2010 already. What about the year 2009 I missed? Thankfully, the limits of every year (it is called contribution) can be cumulative. Any unused contribution can be used in the future. So if I missed 2009, I still can put the year 2009 contribution ($5000) and year 2010 contribution ($5000) together in the year 2010. As of 2020, the cumulated limit is \$69,500 (if you are 18 years of age since 2009 and have a valid social insurance number). Every year's contribution limit can be found from [this page](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html).

Now you know what TFSA account is. I think it is really valuable for the new average engineers who want to plan for the future. Hopefully, it helps you. Next time, let's see what we can do with this TFSA account. See you again guys!

P.S. Sorry about my grammar mistakes. As you guys know, I am ESL. Please correct me, so I can be better!
