Hello guys, Ryan again. Thank you so much everyone who clapped my writings. It was only a few but I couldn’t sleep! (literally, couldn’t sleep with a joy) Anyway, thank you guys so much who read and please feel free to share your thoughts. I really would like to use these posts as a group chat with a bunch of friends. 😊

Last time, we talked about two things:
- what is the “average engineer life scenario"
- what is a TFSA account

We now know there is a TFSA account and the Canadian government wants us to use it. But how can we use it? I think the key is investing in tech 
stocks.

After the COVID pandemic started, I was bored. No social life, no office life, just TV. The news always talked about COVID and the stock market crash. I was curious and started playing with the stock market chart. And I found a really interesting behaviour.

There is a stock market graph called the S&P 500. It is an index that shows the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. Let’s say I am a very cautious guy. I like to invest and make money but I don’t want to lose my precious savings. Also, I have no idea what companies I want to invest in. So, I just decided to buy an ETF (similar to stock but you don’t buy a share of the company, you follow the index) called “SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)”. So whenever 500 companies do well, it goes up. Otherwise, go down. I bought one 5 years ago and forgot about it. And today, I remembered I bought one and decided to find what happened to it.

In 2015, it was around $190. Now, $342. There was up and down but you can see the big trend is going up. Isn’t it interesting? You didn’t even select specific profitable companies. You just bought a little bit of 500 companies in the US and you almost doubled your money in 5 years. If we see about 20 years, even better. It was around $40 in 1993. Times 8 in 20 years… Sounds like a dream.

Let’s check another example. There is a stock market called Nasdaq and there is an ETF called QQQ which tracks the top 100 companies in Nasdaq. Again, I don’t know anything, so I just decided to buy one 5 years ago. Let’s see the graph.

Interesting, almost the same as the other graph. It was $105 in 2015. Now, $283. Doubled and more… I realized the pattern here. There is a lot of ups and downs. But if you see the long term, the overall stock market is growing and getting bigger. I started checking all famous tech companies and big companies. Here are the price changes.

Wow… Amazing, right? And interestingly, even Walmart doubled. It is not even a tech company but still doubled. Too good to be true? Check every tech company stock you know. Compare any previous year and the year after 5. So I concluded the following: If I invest long term (>5 years), I make a profit more than a regular saving account (way more). Also, whatever I make a profit with it, I don’t need to pay any tax with the TFSA account.

Okay, Ryan. I guess I can make money if I invest long term. But… how do I choose what stocks I should buy? I don’t know the graph, I don’t know the stock market, I am not Wall st people. There is one thing we are better than them for sure. We know what techs are awesome.

We know why many developers use Mac os more than Windows. We know how Amazon AWS works and they make tons of money from it. We know Nvidia is not just a graphic card company, but all the data centers and AI computing require their products. We know why Zoom is better than other video conferencing app. We understand what it means Microsoft bought Github. We, average engineers, can verify good tech companies and understand the true values.

All the financial analysis information can be found with so many sources. For example, Yahoo Finance. Or just search for Youtube videos. There are hundreds of videos about Apple stock prediction. But it is hard to understand their true business model and how they are advance than other competitors. But engineers can.

Here is my conclusion — Engineers should buy tech stocks by verifying good tech companies with great technologies and business models. But in the long term and with the TFSA account. Next time, I will talk about the details of my tech stock investment plan. Thank you so much for reading this far! Have a great weekend all!

P.S. Sorry about my grammar mistakes. As you guys know, I am ESL. Please correct me, so I can be better! Also, please check my previous posts and leave comments. I would love to hear your thoughts!
