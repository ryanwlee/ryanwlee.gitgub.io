Hello, everyone! Nice to meet you again! I believe everyone wants to be rich. Money can't buy happiness but you can do many things to make you happy without worrying about the money. At least, that's good enough for me to make a lot of money.

We are software engineers. Of course, top engineers make tons of money. If you are a founder of a new startup and big tech company buys your company, even better. Congrats. But most of us are not like that. We, average engineers, go to work. Earn a salary. If we are lucky, good bonus and stock! To be honest, we get a good paycheck than other jobs. Doing something we like and getting money is awesome!

Let's calculate our good scenario with the salary. We make 80k salary in year 1. And we get a raise 3% every year. Let's make it better, we are lucky and have a house. The income tax is 20%. I want to retire at 50 and live freely before I get too old. I put numbers in Google sheets and here is my calculation how much I earn for 30 years.

I make \$3,044,826.61. Sure, 3 million is big. But remember... this scenario is pretty good. Without any expenses and mortgages. Also, every year bonus. However, I don't think I can call myself rich with that 3 million...

Then average engineers do not have a chance to become rich? I think there are two realistic ways. Side project and tech stock. Before that, we need to talk about TFSA. That would be the next post! See you guys!

P.S. Sorry about my grammar mistakes. As you guys know, I am ESL. Please correct me, so I can be better!
