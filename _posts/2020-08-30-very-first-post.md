Hello, everyone! Nice to meet you! My name is Ryan and I am an average software engineer. I know it is a weird thing to say "average software engineer" but not everyone is Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Wozniak. And I believe most of the people who read this blog do not have their Wikipedia bibliography page. If you have your own Wikipedia page, please mention this blog on Twitter (I am joking but it would be great!).

Enough of jokes, I am just an average software engineer. I just like to build something new. Possibly something can change the world a little bit better. I was good at math, but not good as to become a Nobel prize winner. I good at coding, but I am not as good as MIT's top software engineers.

But I love coding. I love this industry so much. I spend most of my time to try all the new technologies and js library demos. I love to see how technologies change our lives, sometimes worse but most of the time better. And most of the tech companies have us. We, average engineers, are changing the world right now.

I wanted to share stories of my daily life, new techs I love, new libraries I try (maybe simple tutorials), and life lessons I learned. Again, I am an average software engineer, so don't take this blog as a life compass or place to learn professionally. Think of it more like hanging with your engineer friends and talk about things.

Anyway, it is really nice to meet you all! And let's hangout!
