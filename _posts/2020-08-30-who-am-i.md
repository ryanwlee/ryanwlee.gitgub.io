Hello, everyone again! Ryan again. I would like to introduce of myself. I was born in Korea. Came to Canada as an international student when I was 16, grade 10. Then I went University of Toronto and finished computer engineering. Now you know why I have so many grammar errors. Welcome to correct me. I would like to improve my English.

Anyway, after that, pretty much same as most of other software engineers. Interns, big companies, startups, etc. You can take a look all the boring stuff from my [portfolio website](https://www.ryanwlee.com/).

I recently got interested in the stock market. Especially the tech companies I like, Apple, Tesla, etc. That would be the next posts. Meanwhile, I am also into AI, so short tutorials will come! Thanks again everyone. See you next time!
